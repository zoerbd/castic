Features
----------------------
Castic features the most common things you would expect a backup system to do.
Here is an short overview:
	information:
		-> shows overall server information such as available disk space on used partition
		-> lists for each repository important information such as space it takes, date of last check and of course the health status
		-> enables you to take a look at any snapshot you took (including restore and delete options)
	Integrate:
		-> has ansible backend to include new remote systems via ssh
	Misc:
		-> automated checks and mail-notifications
